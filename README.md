## DappSociety Daily Digest Archive

#### What is this?
This is a place where we collect our daily digests in which we collect all the important (and not so important) stuff we do everyday. This helps us to stay focused and not getting lost and promotes transparency.

#### Who can write a daily digest?
Currently the daily digests are composed on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/Gpm7rwac/town-hall) by whoever wants to participate. In the future we will probably have a team designated to writing them (obviously this team will be open for everyone).

#### What is the template for the digests?

A file called `YYYY-MM-DD-daily-digest.md` located in `_posts`
