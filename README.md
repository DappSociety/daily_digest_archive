## DappSociety Daily Digest Archive

#### What is this?
This is a place where we collect our daily digests in which we collect all the important (and not so important) stuff we do everyday. This helps us to stay focused and not getting lost and promotes transparency.

#### Who can write a daily digest?
Currently the daily digests are composed on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/Gpm7rwac/town-hall) by whoever wants to participate. In the future we will probably have a team designated to writing them (obviously this team will be open for everyone).

#### How to contribute?
Each digest has his own master branch, where all contributions are put together. This master branch follows this format: `/wip/YYYY-MM-DD/master`

- To contribute you should fork this master branch following this format: `/wip/YYYY-MM-DD/username`
- Commit changes to the post file (created following the template below).
- **Before merging the changes into the digest's master branch it is important to `pull` to get all changes committed by other users while you were working on your branch.**
- Merge your changes into the **digest master** (**NOT** the repository's `master`)

#### What is the template for the digests?

A file called `YYYY-MM-DD-daily-digest.md` located in `_posts`
