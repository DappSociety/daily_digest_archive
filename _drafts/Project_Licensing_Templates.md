# Project Licensing Templates

>This is a proposal by @baki for allowing people to present their ideas with an agreed upon licensing template. [View the original message on Slack](https://dappsociety.slack.com/archives/C9A0RTC92/p1518817943000112)

When posting an idea/project the original poster can choose from a set of options.

Finally, there could be an option to select whether you want this idea to be protected under the “concept originality” code of conduct within DappSociety, which would mean that forking the idea would be penalized (e.g via our eventual reputation system).

When choosing an option, you must consider how it will go over in the community and the level of support you need. It can be expected that a project marked `Hard Ownership` will get less support than a project marked `Soft Ownership`.

## Hard Ownership
I want to be the owner of this project (I dictate the majority of actions within the group)

## Medium Ownership
I steer the general direction of the project (members can vote on different courses of action)

## Soft Ownership
The entire group has equal voice within the project
