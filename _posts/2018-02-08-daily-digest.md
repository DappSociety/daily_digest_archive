[[Update what we need active volunteers for. Below is ysterdays example which mostly still holds true ]]

It's awesome how everyone is stepping up to the plate to help make this group amazing. But we're not running at optimal efficiency just yet :-)

Please see the `Volunteers Needed` section in [Monday's Daily Digest](https://dappsociety.github.io/daily_digest_archive/daily/2018/02/05/daily-digest.html). What is needed today hasn't changed much since those tasks encompass most of what we are currently working on.

**IMPORTANT: One place where we will need help _right now_ is with writing these daily digests.**

We are going to create a generic template that can be used each day, delegating individuals to write each section. This will streamline the process immediately and be a beneficial structure once we scale, requiring contributions from individuals with more specialized knowledge on projects.

This will be especially important over the next 6 days while @BlockchainBud is out of town. Otherwise, the entire burden is @ericbrown99 :-/

It would be awesome if at least **two more people** would step up to help pull information out of Slack. Even if you don't want to write the formal drafts, you can just leave notes on the Trello cards to be composed at the end of the day.

## In Closing
