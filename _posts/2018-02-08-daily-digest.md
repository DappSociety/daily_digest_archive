## If Nothing Else, Read This
Volunteers are still needed for helping out with writing the dailies.  It's quite the task for 1 or 2 people to do, but with a couple more hands it would be a simple task.

Get involved on the Dapp Ideas Trello board and Slack channel! A lot of projects have been outlined and the best way to learn is by working on projects. By getting involved now, you can drive interest in the projects which you would like to work on more long term. Maybe it's something you've been working on but could use the extra help or advice.

## Daily Intro
Great work to start off the second half of the week, moving into the weekend! We made some awesome progress today discussing the token reward system and our future logo, touching on all sides of the organizations goals. We need to work as a group to maintain momentum.  This weekend could be a great time to get started on some projects! Keep reading to learn more about todays action.

## Notable Events

**Overview:**

* The website is taking shape as well as potential designs for our logo.
* We had a great discussion about building out our rewards system for incentivizing members.
* Conversely the Dapp Ideas page didn't see a whole lot of involvement :(

## Community Projects

#### Logo Concept

Today we saw some good submissions and discussions about our potential logos that you can [see here](https://dappsociety.slack.com/files/U940KDSQ3/F965D9ZNE/image_uploaded_from_ios.jpg). There is now a poll up in `#ballot box` to get feedback on a couple designs and more may be added soon!

#### Website Theme
@tVoid expanded upon yesterdays work on the website, and its starting to really take form. [Check it out](https://dappsociety.github.io/) and join the discussion about our website design, especially if web development is a skill of yours or one at which you want to get better!

Have an opinion on Material CSS or Bootstrap 4 for web frameworks? [Check out the discussion](https://dappsociety.slack.com/archives/C93CZR93K/p1518124058000625)

### Ballot Box
A new poll was posted today by @Olaf regarding our Logo!  They've made some great progress so make sure to [check it out and vote](https://dappsociety.slack.com/files/U955F5K0F/F969J5ZS6/instasize_180208212202.png)

@Livery614 proposed that we should use the slack app "Simple Poll" for voting and posted an example in [#community-management](https://dappsociety.slack.com/archives/C93ARTCGG/p1518125536000404). We will likely be testing that out soon.

The beautiful thing about this is that it not one or the other. **You** are free to choose how you want to run you poll. However, for the time being, let's continue keep all polls (of both types) inside `#ballot-box` for a one-stop voting shop. :-)

We also have a closed poll:
* [Renaming `daily_digest_archive` repo to `digest_archive`](https://dappsociety.slack.com/archives/C94SG4VK7/p1518037202000457) - The changes have been implemented

You can learn more about our other polls in [previous dailies](https://dappsociety.github.io/digest_archive/)!


#### Utilizing Social Media Profiles
We now have a [Medium publication group](https://medium.com/dappsociety) where we can all publish articles under our own author names. The array of topics we can cover is extremely diverse. Don't limit yourself.

>**@BlockchainBud:** **Let me share an example:** I recently wrote a draft for an article that is not directly related to blockchain. It is about managing the dopamine rush of searching social media and reading all the new articles/posts. Severe information overload. I manage this through a GTD (Getting Things Done) system that utilizes various curation tools.

>Then, they key, is to let those articles age in your collection inbox. You can still read them at your leisure, but when you do weekly pruning, you will come across saved articles that are over a month old and are no longer relevant.

> In the prune I did that was the inspiration for the articles, I cleared out over 100 pieces of content that were no longer relevant to me. If we assuming an average of 5-10 minute read, that is 8.5-16.5 (potential) hours saved.

> To close out this anecdote, I tied this into blockchain by opening and closing the article mentioned the speed at which this blockchain space is evolving. If you try to read everything as it comes at you, you will get left behind.

Since Medium doesn't allow several admins to manage the same group, __@tVoid__ is managing the group currently. If you want editor access please post your Medium username in `#access-requests` and ping __@tVoid__.

### New  Slack/Trello Channels
No new channels today, but a lot of great discussions!

### Trello Board Updates

#### [Town Hall](https://trello.com/b/Gpm7rwac/town-hall)

No new updates on town hall, but make sure you check it out or add to it if you haven't had the chance to yet.

#### [Dapp Ideas](https://trello.com/b/UNFkVdpL/dapp-ideas)
**This board has the potential to serve as our main catalyst / motivator for actually getting to work on real blockchain projects.**

@BlockchainBud really built out the Dapp Ideas Trello as well as digesting some great information about the token rewards program in the [project card](https://trello.com/c/1NVM4yp3/4-token-reward-system-for-bootstrapping-projects)

The Dapp Ideas Slack channel didn't get a lot of traffic today, which could be in part because of the great discussion that was had in `#group-contracts`. Lets continue to try and get discussions going in `#dapp-ideas` and people involved with the [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/UNFkVdpL/dapp-ideas)!

## Notable Discussions
Great discussion in `#group-contracts` about how we want to format and build our token rewards system. Its going to take a lot of iterations to properly develop so any thoughts or suggestions are highly encouraged.

Here are some notes from [the discussion](https://dappsociety.slack.com/archives/C9403E24A/p1518071842000196)  There is a lot to go through so I recommend reading through the actual Slack:

* How should we decide value of a task? Maybe via voting and Wisdom of the Crowd. Many groups are working on bounty concepts to solve this issue (ConsenSys, GitCoins, StatusIM, Colony). Bounty systems are even in place in large organizations, but obviously without any decentralization.

* Attach bounties to anything and limit manipulation by utilizing group consensus on bounties. Ensure the ability to fund bounties at any time, even after completion (given that completed work could end up being more valuable than initially perceived)

* We don't want it to be a requirement for bounties to be pitched and promoted by the creator. Important tasks should naturally be shared among the group in order to gain visibility. We could even use our SubReddit and/or write a contract to unbiasedly showcase new and trending bounties.

* Only way to mint tokens is to add them to a shared bounty pool at a fixed rate of supply (adjusting by consensus over time). For them to be added into circulation, they must first be used to fund bounties, and then claimed by the bounty completer(s).

* To incentivize members to "vote" on other projects in a timely manner, unused tokens within the bounty pool could be recycled and redistributed. (**Important:** Any tokes you earn from bounties would be in your wallet and can never be taken away).

* We need to create a way to determine when a bounty is completed to satisfaction / specifications. We could use a poll system to create an oracle for this. Other projects are working on solving this problem so it is likely something we won't have to worry about too much.

For an outline of @BlockchainBud's brain dump, [check out the card on Trello](https://trello.com/c/1NVM4yp3/4-token-reward-system-for-bootstrapping-projects).


## Content Kiosk
@ericbrown99 is going to work on digesting the information in `#content-kiosk` this weekend. Keep your eyes peeled for a link in the Slack and in one of our daily digests early next week!

## Volunteers Needed
Yesterdays section holds up really well for today so I'm going to leave it below:

It's awesome how everyone is stepping up to the plate to help make this group amazing. But we're not running at optimal efficiency just yet :-)

Please see the `Volunteers Needed` section in [Monday's Daily Digest](https://dappsociety.github.io/daily_digest_archive/daily/2018/02/05/daily-digest.html). What is needed today hasn't changed much since those tasks encompass most of what we are currently working on.

**IMPORTANT: One place where we will need help _right now_ is with writing these daily digests.**

We are going to create a generic template that can be used each day, delegating individuals to write each section. This will streamline the process immediately and be a beneficial structure once we scale, requiring contributions from individuals with more specialized knowledge on projects.

This will be especially important over the next 5 days while @BlockchainBud is out of town (returning late Tuesday evening, EST). Otherwise, the entire burden is on @ericbrown99 :-/

It would be awesome if at least **two more people** would step up to help pull information out of Slack. Even if you don't want to write the formal drafts, you can just leave notes on the Trello cards to be composed at the end of the day.

**Important:** Do not worry if English is not your first language. We are an global and all-inclusive group, and the native English speakers of use can always edit your contributions if you'd prefer.

>**Side Note from @BlockchinBud:** I read though half of the official Solidity Documentation / PDF on the airplane today and it's clear that not all contributors have perfect English. But that **does not** detract from the overall value the content provides. The wording and flow can always be improved, much easier than the actual content creation.

> If they can get by without perfect English, so can we! :-D

## In Closing
Moving forward, try to find the aspect of our organization in which you feel you can contribute the most and the one from which you will learn the most! If you're not sure, post in `#needhelp` and others will give you some guidance on which path to take.

The purpose for forming of this group was, after all, to **learn together**! Don't forget that.

This will create a ton of value for the group as a whole and for *you* as an individual. We are all here to develop our skills and product some great projects that will go down in blockchain history! But we must walk before we run.

Even if you don't have a ton of time, go checkout the Trello boards or read the other dailies to stay excited about the work we are doing.

This has been such a great start and successful first week! It's inspiring to see how a group of strangers can gather around a common goal!

**END NOTE:** If you notice any or typos, please help out by cloning, editing, and putting a pull request. If you aren't sure how to do that, simply share you comments and suggestions on Slack.
