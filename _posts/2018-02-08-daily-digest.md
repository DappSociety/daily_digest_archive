## If Nothing Else, Read This
Volunteers are still needed for helping out with writing the dailies.  Its quite the task for 1 or 2 people to do, but with a couple more hands it would be a simple task.  

Get involved on the Dapp Ideas Trello page and Slack channel! A lot of projects have been outlined and the best way to learn is by working on projects. By getting involved now, you can drive interest in the projects which you would like to work on more long term.  Maybe its something you've been working on but could use the extra help or advice!  

## Daily Intro
Great work to start off the second half of the week, moving into the weekend!  We made some awesome progress today discussing the token reward system and our future logo, touching on all sides of the organizations goals. We need to work as a group to maintain momentum.  This weekend could be a great time to get started on some projects! Keep reading to learn more about todays action!

## Notable Events
**Overview:** 
The website is taking shape as well as potential designs for our logo. 
We had a great discussion about building out our rewards system for incentivizing members.
Conversely the Dapp Ideas page didn't see a whole lot of involvement :(

## Community Projects

#### Logo Concept
Today we saw some good submissions and discussions about our potential logos that you can [see here](https://dappsociety.slack.com/files/U940KDSQ3/F965D9ZNE/image_uploaded_from_ios.jpg).  There is now a poll up in `#ballot box` to get feedback on a couple designs and more may be added soon!

#### Website Theme
@tVoid expanded upon yesterdays work on the website, and its starting to really take form. [Check it out](https://dappsociety.github.io/) and join the discussion about our website design, especially if web development is a skill of yours or one at which you want to get better!

Have an opinion on material css or bootstrap 4 for web frameworks? [Check out the discussion](https://dappsociety.slack.com/archives/C93CZR93K/p1518124058000625)


### Ballot Box
A new poll was posted today by @Olaf regarding our Logo!  They've made some great progress so make sure to [check it out and vote](https://dappsociety.slack.com/files/U955F5K0F/F969J5ZS6/instasize_180208212202.png)

@Livery614 proposed that we should use the slack app "Simple Poll" for voting and posted an example in [#community-management](https://dappsociety.slack.com/archives/C93ARTCGG/p1518125536000404).  We will likely be testing that out soon! 

You can learn more about our other polls in [previous dailies](https://dappsociety.github.io/digest_archive/)!

### New  Slack/Trello Channels
No new channels today, but a lot of great discussions!

### Trello Board Updates

#### [Town Hall](https://trello.com/b/Gpm7rwac/town-hall)
No new updates on town hall, but make sure you check it out or add to it if you haven't had the chance to yet!

#### [Dapp Ideas](https://trello.com/b/UNFkVdpL/dapp-ideas)
**This board has the potential to serve as our main catalyst / motivator for actually getting to work on real blockchain projects.**
@BlockchainBud really built out the Dapp Ideas Trello as well as digesting some great information about the token rewards program in the [project card](https://trello.com/c/1NVM4yp3/4-token-reward-system-for-bootstrapping-projects)

The slack channel didn't get a lot of of traffic today, which could be in part because of the great discussion that was had in `#Group-Contracts`.  Lets continue to try and get discussions going in the slack and people involved with the trello board!

## Notable Discussions 
Great discussion in `#group-contracts` about how we want to format and build our token rewards system. Its going to take a lot of iterations to properly develop so any thoughts or suggestions are highly encouraged.

Here are some notes from [the discussion](https://dappsociety.slack.com/archives/C9403E24A/p1518071842000196)  There is a lot to go through so I recommend reading through the actual slack: 

* How should we decide value of a task? Maybe via group wisdom and voting. Many groups are using bounties to solve this issue (ConsenSys, GitCoins, StatusIBM)
* Attach bounties to anything and limit manipulation by utilizing group consensus on bounties. Ensre the ability to fund bounties at any time, even after completion (given that completed work could end up being more valuable than initially percieved
* We dont want to require marketing bounties. Make sure the bounties are fundable and payable to multiple people
* Only way to mint tokens is to include them into circulation is by initially including them as part of a bounty. Unused bounty tokens that were paid out will be recycled. This is incentive to "vote" on other projects in a timely maner
* Need to create a way to determine when a bounty is complete. Use a poll system to create an oracle
* Outline of BlockchainBuds brain dump in [the trello](https://trello.com/c/1NVM4yp3/4-token-reward-system-for-bootstrapping-projects).

## Content Kiosk
@ericbrown99 is going to work on digesting the information in `#contentKisok` this weekend.  Keep your eyes peeled for a link in the slack and in one of our daily digests early next week!

## Volunteers Needed
Yesterdays section holds up really well for today so I'm going to leave it below: 

It's awesome how everyone is stepping up to the plate to help make this group amazing. But we're not running at optimal efficiency just yet :-)

Please see the `Volunteers Needed` section in [Monday's Daily Digest](https://dappsociety.github.io/daily_digest_archive/daily/2018/02/05/daily-digest.html). What is needed today hasn't changed much since those tasks encompass most of what we are currently working on.

**IMPORTANT: One place where we will need help _right now_ is with writing these daily digests.**

We are going to create a generic template that can be used each day, delegating individuals to write each section. This will streamline the process immediately and be a beneficial structure once we scale, requiring contributions from individuals with more specialized knowledge on projects.

This will be especially important over the next 6 days while @BlockchainBud is out of town. Otherwise, the entire burden is @ericbrown99 :-/

It would be awesome if at least **two more people** would step up to help pull information out of Slack. Even if you don't want to write the formal drafts, you can just leave notes on the Trello cards to be composed at the end of the day.

## In Closing
Moving forward, try and find the aspect of our organization in which you feel you can contribute the most and the one from which you will learn the most! This will create a ton of value for the group as a whole and for *you* as an individual.  We are all here to develop our skills and make some great products! Even if you don't have a ton of time, go checkout the Trello pages or read the other dailies to stay excited about the work we are doing. This has been such a great start and successful first week! Its inspiring to see how a group of strangers can gather around a common goal!

**END NOTE:** If I missed anything or made a couple typos, please feel free to edit the daily or reach out!
