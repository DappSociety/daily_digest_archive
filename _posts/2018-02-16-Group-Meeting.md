# Group Meeting: February 16, 2018

## Executive Summary
Members discussed ownership, governance, vision, and goals. Takeaways resulted in immediate organization of the Trello Board Community Enhancements. Members will use to organize teams and tasks and can change tools if teams agree.

Ownership and governance were the hottest topics. While still ideas we need to pin down and clarify as a community, especially with the concept of "ownership" of projects, we will likey need to continue to discuss this in following meetings to nail down the design.

> From my own observation, it appeared to me that people were in favor of not guarding ideas if posted within the DS  ecosystem. Governance being accepted as a large project that might align itself with a bounty DApp created by DS members.
