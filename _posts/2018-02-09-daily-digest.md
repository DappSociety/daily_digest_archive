#### Utilizing Social Media Profiles


### New  Slack/Trello Channels
We now have a [#attachments](https://dappsociety.slack.com/messages/C96PYAY6N) channel for posting files. It's recommended that if you want to share a file you post it there and then link to it instead of posting the file in another channel, this way we can create threads under your message (which is impossible if the file is sent directly).

### Trello Board Updates

#### [Town Hall](https://trello.com/b/Gpm7rwac/town-hall)
No activity here today :(

#### [Dapp Ideas](https://trello.com/b/UNFkVdpL/dapp-ideas)
**This board has the potential to serve as our main catalyst / motivator for actually getting to work on real blockchain projects.**
Tomas Roaldsnes idea about a time locked savings game is getting traction and quite a bit has been discussed about it today (mainly on Slack, [here](https://dappsociety.slack.com/files/U947MNU2X/F96661NDP/timecontractsavingsaccount_whitepaper.pdf))

## Notable Discussions
@manchaary and @rxdizzle have suggested creating producthunt-like Dapp review site [[ add link to @manchaary's Trello card here ]]

## Content Kiosk
@BlockchainBud has shared an article about Dapp scaling using sidechains: [link](https://medium.com/loom-network/dappchains-scaling-ethereum-dapps-through-sidechains-f99e51fff447)
