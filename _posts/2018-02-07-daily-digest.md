We made a lot of great progress again today! As we continue to grow, we are continually working to streamline our process. Today we took some important steps to improve our foundation for creating projects and publishing them for anyone to view.  From creating an intial skeleton for our website, to building out the Dapp Ideas Trello page, we are making a lot of progress. Keep reading to get the details!

If you missed any of the previous Daily Digests, don't forget to check them out at our [Static Archive](https://dappsociety.github.io/daily_digest_archive/).

## Current Stats
**Daily Active Users:** 46

**Public vs Private messages:** 93% public!!!

## Notable Events
**Overview:** We had a really great discussion about website domains and how we want to utilize the domains that BlockchainBud reserved (make your opinion known by voting in ` ballot-box`!).  We have our first submission for a potential logo as well as a framework for our website! Additionally we have a couple new slack channels and a beefed up Dapp Ideas trello page **with voting**.

## Community Projects

#### First Logo Concept
@Olaf has taken the initiative to create our first logo concept! He did a great job, so if you haven't seen it yet, [check it out here](https://dappsociety.slack.com/archives/C95CY7JEN/p1518032966000732).

If you have any constructive suggestions for him, please be sure to add them to the `#design` channel.

And of course, if any of you other designers out there want to give a shot at making one, please do. Then we can conduct a poll and see which the group prefers.

**Important Note:** If you are working on a logo, keep in mind that we are *not* exclusively about Ethereum. We are about *blockchain / decentralization / distributed ledger technology.*

#### Utilizing Social Media Profiles
We haven't had any discussions yet about how to best utilize our social media presence, but @Olaf has stepped up to the plate here as well. He will be an admin for the Twitter profile. If anyone else is interested in utilizing any of the social media profiles please join the discussion in `#social-media`.

#### Website Theme
@tVoid has started working on a initial theme for our home page. It's still a work in progress but the initiative is great! [Check it out here](https://dappsociety.github.io/).

#### Slack Channel Archive
@manchaary has created a script to extract and archive the `#introductions` into git. It's still a work in progress but you can checkout the first extractions [here](http://manch.pw/dappsociety/introparser/).

### Ballot Box
We currently have three polls running. Two from yesterday and one from today.

* [Renaming `daily_digest_archive` repo to `digest_archive`](https://dappsociety.slack.com/archives/C94SG4VK7/p1518037202000457)
* [Trivial Test Poll - How Should We Vote?](https://dappsociety.slack.com/archives/C94SG4VK7/p1517938181000786) - Looks like using Emojis is going to win this round.
* [Which Domain Name Should Be Our Primary?](https://dappsociety.slack.com/archives/C94SG4VK7/p1517938181000786) - More discussion took place [startin here](https://dappsociety.slack.com/archives/C93CZR93K/p1517992036000361) in `#general`

**Important:** If you haven't yet voted in these polls, please do. Your input is important to the group.

### New Slack Channels
Two more channels were added today, for a total of 13.

* `#design` - We had a lot of designers wanting to contribute to the group but not knowing how without a programming background. Discussion is already taking place about our logo with @Olaf submitting the first concept!

* `social-media` - For all discussion related to our social media profiles. @Olaf has volunteered to be one of the Twitter admins. If anyone else is interested in utilizing the social media profiles (Twitter, Facebook Page, Reddit, etc) please join the discussion over there.

Any channels added after you signed up (or if you signed up before the default channels were added) can be found by clicking the word `Channels` above your channel list. From there you can join any of them.

### Trello Board Updates
@BlockchainBud made some organizational changes to the Trello boards in an effort to keep them current and more user friendly. If you haven't yet, please join the Trello team and start adding cards, boards, comments, etc.

#### [Town Hall](https://trello.com/b/Gpm7rwac/town-hall)
Don't forget about the `Suggestion Box` list on this board:

* If you have any suggestions for our group (not Dapp Ideas) add them here!
* Add yourself as a member of the card so we know who's suggestion it is and so you get notifications to activity on it
* If you have any questions about how to use this, just give it a try or ask in the `#needhelp` channel.

Once this list gets large, we will break it out into a separate board and add the "Card Voting" power up.

Other changes to the Town Hall board:
* Cleaned out `Inbox` list
* Added `Information Index` list. Eventually this will be moved over to our static HTML wiki.
* Removed `Daily Digest` planning list in favor of a dedicated board.

#### [Dapp Ideas](https://trello.com/b/UNFkVdpL/dapp-ideas)
This board has the potential to serve as our main catalyst / motivator for actually getting to work on real blockchain projects.

Many of our ideas have been added and segmented into categorized lists. The Card Voting power up has also been added. When you open each card, you should see a "Vote" button on the right hand side near the bottom of the buttons list. Cast your votes and leave comments on your favorite ideas.

**Please** add your ideas with yourself as a member on the card (or claim your ideas if they are already there).

## Notable Discussions and Announcements
The debate continues surounding domain names and how to best utilize them to communicate our work online. Check out the discussion in #general, [starting here](https://dappsociety.slack.com/archives/C93CZR93K/p1517992036000361)
and then **go vote** in #ballot-box.

`#content-kiosk` had some really great content added today. Definitely check it out if you are interested in podcasts!

## Volunteers Needed
It's awesome how everyone is stepping up to the plate to help make this group amazing. But we're not running at optimal efficiency just yet :-)

Please see the `Volunteers Needed` section in [Monday's Daily Digest](https://dappsociety.github.io/daily_digest_archive/daily/2018/02/05/daily-digest.html). What is needed today hasn't changed much since those tasks encompass most of what we are currently working on.

**IMPORTANT: One place where we will need help _right now_ is with writing these daily digests.**

We are going to create a generic template that can be used each day, delegating individuals to write each section. This will streamline the process immediately and be a beneficial structure once we scale, requiring contributions from individuals with more specialized knowledge on projects.

This will be especially important over the next 6 days while @BlockchainBud is out of town. Otherwise, the entire burden is @ericbrown99 :-/

It would be awesome if at least **two more people** would step up to help pull information out of Slack. Even if you don't want to write the formal drafts, you can just leave notes on the Trello cards to be composed at the end of the day.

## In Closing
Keep up the great work within Slack. The interaction going on between each other will fuel our motivation to persist.

We also need to continue thinking about getting down to the actual development work which was the catalyst for this group. It is imperative that you add your ideas to the [Dapp Ideas Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/UNFkVdpL/dapp-ideas) so we can all get a birds eye view of our options.

Once you add a card, make sure you add yourself onto the card. Then, continue to build out the card with more details in the description, by attaching links and photos, by adding comments, and more. This keeps all of the information easily accessible within the proper context.

Everyone one of us has something to contribute, so don't be afraid to be a part of the discussion, ~~even~~ especially if you feel you don't have as much experience as others here. We are all here to learn and to help each other!

No one needs permission to start working on **any** of the ideas listed. You can start working on your own or rally a small group. Just get started and others will join in.

Getting just one small team started on a real blockchain project will be a very good testament to our group's mission. Lets continue to optimize our processes and gain momentum going into the second half of the week so we can reach this goal faster!

>I will be publishing Solidity code throughout next week as I experiment with the [StandardBounties](https://medium.com/gitcoin/integrating-standard-bounties-dc4cf62bf814) contracts (by ConsenSys) and do research into a reward system for our group. My belief is that as more of us start pushing code, it will fuel our energy, attracting collaborators to each project. The hardest step is getting started.
