Currently only @ericbrown99 and @tVoid are working on the daily digests, help would be highly appreciated!
We currently only have one fleshed out logo idea (by @Olaf), so if you are into design you could help contributing ideas in [#design][#design]. There are already a few different ideas posted, but we definitely need to develop these further and discuss them.
