Another day and even more progress has been made. It's exciting to see more and more members taking ownership of this project.

## Notable Events
Our group is now comprised of 56 members, leading to a snowball of effort. **93%** of our messages have been posted in public channels! The other 7% are all in direct messages (0% private messages :-) ).  Lets keep this up to share the wealth of knowledge.

### Increased Engagement
More people have been added to the Slack owners' team, the Trello team, and the GitHub team. If you haven't been added yet, simply make a post in `#access-requests`.

**Note:** To maintain continuity and clarity, try to have similar usernames across these three platforms.

Soon we will have analytics available in Slack and have another way to chart our engagement growth!

### New Slack Channels
Three new channels were added today, bringing our total to 11.

* `#ballot-box` - Used for all-inclusive group voting. [View original message](https://dappsociety.slack.com/team/U93CZR0LR).
* `#group-repos` - Use for overall discussion of our repos. We will split into dedicated project channels when needed.
* `#off-topic` - Even though blockchain is our idea of fun, let's have some extra fun in there. It'll make our group even stronger.

And to make finding channels easier, we added default channels to new user registrations. [View original message](https://dappsociety.slack.com/archives/C93ARTCGG/p1517939317000065).

Any channels added after you signed up (or if you signed up before the default channels were added) can be found by clicking the word `Channels` above your channel list. From there you can join any of them.

__To anyone who is, or becomes, a Slack owner:__

There is a workspace setting titled `Default Channels` for new members. We should make sure this is always up to date so new members don't (1) think there is no discussion going on or (2) wonder why they can't see the channels.

https://dappsociety.slack.com/admin/settings#default_channels

Once we have a _lot_ of channels (like for individual dev projects), it won't make sense to add them all, but we should at least add the important ones by default.

### `#ballot-box`
As previously mentioned, the `#ballot-box` channel was added today. We are doing a trial run to create an all-inclusive goup voting system via slack. 

**Quick Note:** In `#ballot-box` we want to keep all of the discussions in side threads so that the main channel only has votes. This makes it easier to quickly find results. Today we slipped up on that, so lets work on improving this tomorrow!

#### Trivial Test Poll
In this poll the organization can decide whether to use emoji reactions for voting or a slack voting integration. This will likely decide how we do voting for a decent period in the short run, so make your opinion known!

#### Domain Name Poll
@BlockchainBud has purchased **4** domain names for our project! What do you prefer?:
  1. dappsociety.io
  2. dappsociety.net
  3. dappsociety.com
  4. dappsociety.org
  
Check out the poll so we can continue to work on our website and get it published (with your favorite domain).


### New Repos Launched

#### Daily Digest Archive
Awesome work by __@tVoid__ setting up our [daily digest archive repo](https://github.com/DappSociety/daily_digest_archive) that uses Jekyll to generate a static site as an archive. [View the HTML output here](https://dappsociety.github.io/daily_digest_archive/).

This is essential to our workflow for collaborating on information. Going forward, we will be publishing the Daily Digests here and developing new systems for our group to collaborate on written information.

If you would like to submit any edits, follow the contribution guidelines on the repo home page. And be sure to add your name to the credits at the bottom ;-)

#### Resources Dashboard
And an equally awesome job done by __@manchaary__ in setting up our [resources dashboard repo](https://github.com/DappSociety/resources_dashboard). [View the HTML output here](https://dappsociety.github.io/resources_dashboard/).

This is a great start for our knowledgebase / wiki. Our aim is to have all group knowledge centrally accessible and fully open source. We are looking into using a static site generator with a wiki theme for this.

__@manchaary__ is building on his work by experimenting with extracting `#introductions` into an initial team directory using the Slack API. This will also form a foundation of automatically archiving important Slack information, which can then be collaboratively cleaned up, curated, and indexed.

### Trello Town Hall Board Additions

* Added a Suggestions Box list. [View message on Slack](https://dappsociety.slack.com/archives/C93CZR93K/p1517945791000408).
* Added a [Polls index card](https://trello.com/c/CyOTAFX8/10-polls) to showcase past and present polls from `#ballot-box`.
* Added more content to [Sub-Projects Organization card](https://trello.com/c/GZybCKir/3-sub-projects-organization). If you volunteered to help with anything, please add it to this card to keep it updated.

### SubReddit Registered
Thank you to __@tbone__ for registering the [DappSociety SubReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dappsociety/) for the group. However, there is no content there and we don't really know the best way to take advantage of it just yet.

Initial talks about using Reddit were brought up during a discussion in `#community-management`. [View the start of that conversion here](https://dappsociety.slack.com/team/U94HLJEP7).

* __@rxdizzle:__ iirc you can use the automod functionality to create a daily “discussion” thread. Subreddit = daily pinned digests / wiki / materials / ideas / new joiner information / non-urgent requests
* __@ericbrown99:__ I think that could be a good way to keep the urgent information accessible and uncluttered.  So long as people don't feel its too many mediums, which I don't think should be a problem given that most people here likely already actively engage with most of these.
* __@blockchainbud:__ I think as long as we have a central knowledge base, and a team effort to organize information there, then the issue of too many mediums is not really a problem.
* __@blockchainbud:__ Where a sub-Reddit would fit into our strategy, in my opinion, would be as self-curating message board. But I still think we would want to pull Reddit stuff into our version controlled information (digests, wiki, etc), since information does get buried there too.

## Notable Discussion and Announcements
A lot of great discussion took place today that is continuing to pave the way for a very efficient group.  Interested in *identity management*? Check out the `#dapp-ideas` channel! 

### Curating and Archiving Content
In `#community-management` we were discussing how to curate and archive our content in an open source and collaborative way. [View the start of the conversation](https://dappsociety.slack.com/archives/C93ARTCGG/p1517930544000374).

* We should store content as `.md` in Git repos
* Anyone can collaborate by forking, branching, merging, etc.
* Anyone can re-purpose and/or format the content

Examples of content re-purposing:

* Static site generators for blogs, books, wikis, newsletters
* GitHub Pages

Benefits of open source, collaborative content:

* Central medium for the most important content
* Flexibility for users to choose their personal tools of choice
* Knowledge base can grow and improve without restrictions

We will likely be publishing content/guides that help the global ecosystem and we want our content to be as accessible as possible! Storing our source material under version control gives us ultimate flexibility and potential for collaboration, not just among ourselves, but among anyone who finds it.

## Volunteers Needed
It's awesome how everyone is stepping up to the plate to help make this group amazing. But we're not running at optimal efficiency just yet :-)

Please see the `Volunteers Needed` section in [yesterday's Daily Digest](https://dappsociety.github.io/daily_digest_archive/daily/2018/02/05/daily-digest.html). What is needed today hasn't changed much since those tasks encompass most of what we are currently working on.

One place where we will need help in the near future is with writing the **daily digests**.  We are going to create a generic template that can be used each day, delegating individuals to write each section. This will streamline the process immediately and be a beneficial structure once we scale, requiring contributions from individuals with more specialized knowledge on projects. 

## Important for Our Success
As mentioned yesterday, we need to keep up our enthusiasm. We are doing a great job at that and the momentum is really building.

We also need to start thinking about getting down to the actual development work which was the catalyst for this group. Continue to throw out ideas, and then at some point, we should schedule a focused discussion around one or more of the ideas. Everyone here has something to contribute so don't be afraid to be a part of the discussion, ~~even~~ especially if you feel you don't have as much experience as others here. We are all hear to learn and to help eachother!

Getting just one small team started on a real blockchain project will be a very good testament to our group's mission.  Lets continue to optimize our process and gain momentum going into the second half of the week so we can reach this goal faster!
